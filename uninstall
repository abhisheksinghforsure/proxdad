# This script uninstalls ProxDad version "v1.0" from a user's system. 
#
#
# It first checks if ProxDad is already uninstalled and if it's currently running.
# If not running, it prompts the user for confirmation to uninstall. 
# Upon confirmation, it removes the ProxDad installation directory /.proxdad and 
# its contents, then eliminates references to ProxDad in the user's .bashrc 
# file. Afterward, it informs the user of successful uninstallation and sources 
# the .bashrc file to apply changes.
